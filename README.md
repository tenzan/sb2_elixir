# Sb2Phoenix

## Purpose

 1. To connect to an existing MySQL database
 2. Implement realtime updates, i.e. when I do CRUD operations on one browser it should reflect changes in realtime on another browser.

## Problem

 * The item #2 of the purpose above has not been yet solved.

## To start your Phoenix app:

  1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  2. Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  3. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).
